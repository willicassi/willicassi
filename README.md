## About Me
Hello World! I am Cassidy, a senior Computer Science student with a focus on Cybersecurity.

## Capstone Project

[Website Security Research Project](https://github.com/willicassi/Website_Security_Research_Project) 
- My Website Security Research Project is an intentionally vulnerable web application for users to learn about various common web vulnerabilities. 
- The web application allows for users to perform guided attacks with the help of Vulnerability Reports and learn about appropriate mitigations for these attacks. 
- Alternatively, advanced users could perform their own penetration testing on the web application, to identify additional vulnerabilities and gain experience with web vulnerabilities and mitigations.
