# My Senior Capstone Project
## Website Security
### About
My Senior Capstone Project involves a web application featuring a series of web-based vulnerabilities. 
[The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/about/) provides a Top 10 list of the most critical and common security risks to web applications.
This list is updated every few years, and we are awaiting the release of the OWASP Top Ten 2025.

My website features a subset of the [OWASP Top Ten 2021](https://owasp.org/Top10/) vulnerabilties. 
For each vulnerability addressed in my website, I have made a vulnerability report which details a potential attack and mitigations.
Each mitigation is toggleable so you may interact with the website with and without defenses in place. 
The purpose of the website is to allow you to explore and learn more about different web vulnerabilities and their mitigations.
[Explore the site](http://35.247.51.103:8080/) and see how many vulnerabilities you can exploit!

### Vulnerabilities
The website currently features the following vulnerabilities:

### How to Use
To interact with the website, first read through the homepage, which provides links to each vulnerability report as well as user credentials for the website, which are required for some of the attacks.
You may either explore the website without guidance to challenge yourself to identify where the vulnerabilities are present, or you may follow along with any of the attacks detailed in the vulnerability reports.

To learn about the defense, read the vulnerability report, then toggle the vulnerability on the website.
Experiment with the website with vulnerabilties enabled and disabled to see if you can still successfully perform an attack.


Note: As the website is intentionally vulnerable, please do not enter any personal information. Use a fake name if you "sign up"!

Another Note: If the website goes down, it is likely temporary. I may be actively working on it, so be patient, but feel free to contact me if you are unable to access the website!
